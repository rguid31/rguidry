    <h2>Introduction: Why This Story Matters</h2>
    <p>In my ninth year of college, I realized I'd spent more time navigating the <em>system</em> than actually learning in it.</p>
    <p>From <strong>2014 to 2023</strong>, I was a chemical engineering student at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louisiana State University</a>—over 140 credit hours, multiple internships, and more self-learning than most degree programs ever require. I recorded a video in <strong>June 2023</strong> to share my journey, and what I've learned since is that my story isn't unique.</p>
    <p>Students across the country—especially in engineering—recognize the same mix of hope, frustration, and determination. This post is for them, for prospective students, for educators, and for anyone who believes higher education can do better.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>When I arrived at LSU in <strong>fall 2014</strong>, I was ready. My senior year of high school was packed with engineering prep: physics, drafting, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoCAD</a>, electronics, robotics. I chose chemical engineering because I was told the options were "limitless"—petrochemicals, refining, biotech, and more.</p>
    <p>The first two years were demanding but energizing. I landed internships with <a href="https://www.gp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia-Pacific</a> and <a href="https://www.emerson.com/en-us/automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emerson Automation Solutions</a>, and I pursued extra professional development in <a href="https://www.osha.gov/safety-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">safety training</a>.</p>

    <h3>The Scheduling Challenge — and Its Improvement</h3>
    <p>In my early years, some core courses were offered in just one term (fall <em>or</em> spring). If you missed one due to life, illness, or a co-op, you could be delayed a full year. Over time, the department <em>did</em> expand availability across more semesters—an important fix that helped newer cohorts avoid those bottlenecks.</p>

    <h3>Other Roadblocks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Advising gaps:</strong> Even with 140+ credits, trying to pivot degrees meant confusion about course equivalencies and what would actually count.</li>
      <li><strong>Support struggles:</strong> Navigating <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/disability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disability services</a> felt like a bureaucratic maze—appeals returned template-like denials instead of genuine conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial stress:</strong> Losing merit aid (e.g., <a href="https://mylosfa.la.gov/students-parents/scholarships-grants/tops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPS</a>) after a rough semester can mean thousands in unexpected costs with limited paths to regain eligibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These aren't just my experiences. Public <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LSU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">student forums</a> and <a href="https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-state-university/reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reviews</a> mention similar themes: advising inconsistencies, funding insecurity, and a heavy burden of self-navigation.</p>

    <h2>The Sugarcane Example: A Missed Opportunity</h2>

    <!-- 3) SUGARCANE IMAGE — REPLACE src -->

      <figcaption>Louisiana sugarcane — a major local industry that never showed up in my curriculum.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Louisiana is a top producer of sugarcane, and sugar refining is a major state industry. My family roots are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliano,_Louisiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galliano</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Meadow,_Louisiana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golden Meadow</a>—places where sugarcane and coastal industries still shape daily life.</p>
    <p>And yet, in nine years of chemical engineering coursework, <strong>not a single class</strong> covered sugarcane processing. This isn't unique to LSU—<a href="https://www.abet.org/accreditation/criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-engineering-programs-2024-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABET requirements</a> leave limited room for region-specific electives—but it's a missed chance to link students to jobs right outside our doorstep.</p>

    </figure>

    <h3>1) Curriculum Rigidity (Early Years)</h3>
    <p>Before course availability expanded, a rigid sequence could set you back a year if you missed a single class. The later fix proved departments can adapt when they listen to student feedback.</p>

    <h3>2) Advising Gaps</h3>
    <p>Faculty advisors exist, but many students describe general advising that doesn't match program realities. You'll see that reflected across <a href="https://www.niche.com/colleges/louisiana-state-university/reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review sites</a> and discussions.</p>

    <h3>3) Financial Pitfalls</h3>
    <p>Merit aid like <a href="https://mylosfa.la.gov/students-parents/scholarships-grants/tops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPS</a> can disappear after one bad semester, making the path forward far more expensive—or impossible—to navigate.</p>

    <h3>4) Cultural Climate</h3>
    <p>Mutual respect matters. I've had professors who welcomed questions and others who seemed to see them as interruptions. In a field built on collaboration, that difference is everything.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="respect">
    <h2>Why Mutual Respect Matters</h2>

    <!-- 5) STUDY GROUP — REPLACE src -->
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/blog/1. The-Harsh-Truth-About-College/Study Group Session.jpg"

           alt="Four students collaborating around a laptop with textbooks open" />
      <figcaption>Study rooms and late nights — where I learned as much from peers as I did from lectures.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>If I could add one universal rule to higher education, it would be this: <strong>Mutual respect should be as non-negotiable as academic integrity.</strong></p>
    <p>Respect means acknowledging that paths differ, that feedback deserves real answers, and that policies should be explained—not hidden behind "that's just how it's done." Without it, collaboration and innovation stall.</p>

  <section id="change">
    <h2>Reflection on Change Over Time</h2>

    <!-- 6) CAMPUS WALKWAY — REPLACE src -->

           width="1200" height="800"
           alt="Students walking along a shaded LSU pathway with books and backpacks" />
      <figcaption>Change came slowly—better course availability, more flexible teaching, improved spaces—but for many in my cohort, it arrived late.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Not every problem persisted. Course availability improved. Some faculty embraced more flexible, responsive teaching. New lab spaces and updated technology arrived. But these changes took years, and for many of us, the timing still meant delays or missed opportunities.</p>

  <section id="paths">
    <h2>Paths Forward: How We Fix This</h2>
    <p>Despite its flaws, chemical engineering can be incredibly rewarding—if approached with self-reliance and a willingness to learn beyond the classroom.</p>

    <h3>For Students</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Teach yourself early:</strong> Use <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a>, and high-quality industry channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ChemicalEngineeringGuy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Engineering Guy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Network relentlessly:</strong> Co-ops and internships open doors that grades alone can't. Check out <a href="https://www.aiche.org/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIChE career resources</a> for industry connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask "why"—always:</strong> Challenge unclear requirements and seek explanations, respectfully and persistently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Schools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Update curricula regularly:</strong> Integrate local industry projects and cross-disciplinary work.</li>
      <li><strong>Improve advising:</strong> Ensure program-specific expertise and faster responses.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase transparency:</strong> Publish graduation rates, job placement data, and total cost in plain language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q&amp;A: Common Questions I Get</h2>

    <p><strong>How hard is chemical engineering at LSU?</strong><br />
    It's math-heavy and structured; the challenge is balancing workload while navigating the system.</p>

    <p><strong>Can you succeed without internships?</strong><br />
    Possible, but much harder. Practical experience gives you leverage coursework alone can't.</p>

    <p><strong>Is DEI helping or hurting engineering?</strong><br />
    When done well, it opens doors and builds belonging. The focus should be on both inclusivity <em>and</em> merit.</p>

    <p><strong>What's the truth about GPA in engineering?</strong><br />
    A perfect GPA isn't the only marker of readiness. Many capable engineers learn most from setbacks.</p>

    <p><strong>Should I transfer if I'm unhappy?</strong><br />
    If concerns are structural (advising, access, culture), consider transferring early before sunk costs rise.</p>

    <p><strong>How do you balance workload and mental health?</strong><br />
    Protect downtime. Schedule non-negotiable breaks, even during peak exam weeks.</p>

    <p><strong>Is the financial investment worth it?</strong><br />
    With internships, networking, and an on-time finish, ChemE can deliver strong ROI. Without those, it's less certain.</p>

    <p><strong>One thing I'd tell incoming freshmen?</strong><br />
    Learn to advocate for yourself early—politely, persistently, and with documentation.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts: Why I Still Believe in Change</h2>
    <p>From <strong>fall 2014 to spring 2023</strong>, I lived almost every aspect of the engineering student experience: early excitement, mid-degree burnout, roadblocks, small wins, and breakthroughs from teaching myself what the curriculum left out.</p>
    <p>In <strong>June 2023</strong>, I decided to share my story because it's not just mine—it reflects the hopes and frustrations of countless others.</p>
    <p>This is my open invitation to students, faculty, alumni, and industry partners: let's talk honestly about what's working and what's not. Let's push for transparency, respect, and adaptability in higher education. If we build that kind of system, it won't just prepare us for our first jobs—it'll prepare us for a lifetime of solving problems, together.</p>
